    "**Project Overview**\n",
    "The Advanced Computing Center for Research and Education (ACCRE) operates Vanderbilt University's high-performance computing cluster. Jobs submitted to ACCRE are managed by the [slurm scheduler](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html), which tracks compute and memory resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "ACCRE staff have hypothesized that the scheduler sometimes becomes unresponsive because it is processing large bursts of job completions. This especially affects automated job submitters, such as members of the Open Science Grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to evaluate whether the data supports the hypothesis of bursts of job completions contributing to scheduler unresponsiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are provided three datasets:  \n",
    "* fullsample.csv: Contains slurm job records. Job completions correspond to jobs in the \"COMPLETED\" state with exit code \"0:0\".  \n",
    "* slurm_wrapper_ce5.log, slurm_wrapper_ce6.log: These log files contain every slurm command executed by the CE5 and CE6 servers (gateways to the Open Science Grid).  \n",
    "Unresponsive periods are indicated by \"sbatch\" commands from user 9204 that have:  \n",
